1. extract
GOAL: json data > "in-memory columnar data structure" like pandas dataframe

    a. load json data from json file (test.json right now / located in data directory, for now). This uses pandas, and loads into dataframe 
    b. export dataframe to csv as "extracted data" to be used by the "transform" process

    Possible changes: 
    - as part of SQL-shift, change from current process that ends with csv > to process that loads directly into database (SQLite, for now)

2. transform
GOAL: make sure data is usable for analysis. not a lot of specifics necessary with the current data
    ^ if multiple sources were being extracted, this could standardize them before loading into database/data warehouse

    Possible changes:
    - consider separating out month data? Or see how that could be achieved through views

3. load
GOAL: load data into database/data warehouse

    a. create DB & create connection
    b. load data into DB
    c. close connection

    Possible changes:
    - alternative options: currently always create/replace > add options to add to existing?
